  This skill should be used when the user asks to "design an MCP server", "audit an MCP server",
  "review MCP tools", "add MCP tool", "improve tool descriptions", "design tool surface",
  "add submit_feedback tool", "review tool schema", mentions "MCP transport", "tool annotations",
  "mcp stdio", "MCP Resources", "MCP Prompts", or is designing, reviewing, or auditing any MCP server.
  Covers design philosophy, tool naming, parameter schemas, agent UX, feedback channel,
  transport, security, and client compatibility. NOT for hands-on implementation from scratch

# Building MCP Servers

SDK setup, scaffolding, language idioms → [`mcp-builder`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/mcp-builder).

## Scope Tags

This skill intentionally mixes universal MCP guidance with narrower production recipes. Treat
the tags below as binding when applying the references:

- **UNIVERSAL** — applies to any MCP server, independent of language, SDK, transport, or host
- **OPINIONATED** — recommended default distilled from one or a handful of real production
  servers, not from controlled studies. Treat as a strong starting point worth measuring on
  your own surface; adapt or skip when it does not match the project. Items that cite a
  specific study or n-of-servers do so inline.
- **STACK-SPECIFIC** — applies only to the named stack, framework, client, or deployment shape; inline as `[STACK:label]` where `label` names the specific stack (e.g. `[STACK:Python]`, `[STACK:stateful-backends]`)
- **EMPIRICAL** — observed client behaviour; verify when the client version or date matters
- **CONDITIONAL** — applies when the named precondition holds (specific transport, deployment
  shape, or stack); skip otherwise

When in doubt, enforce UNIVERSAL rules first. Do not treat OPINIONATED or STACK-SPECIFIC recipes
as protocol requirements.

## Glossary

| Term | Design meaning |
|------|----------------|
| `stdio` / `Streamable HTTP` | The two MCP transports. Pick by who-launches-whom — see §Transport. |
| **Resource** | A primitive *selected and injected by the client*, not invoked by the model. Use when context is stable and URI-addressable. → [tool-design.md §Picking a Primitive](references/tool-design.md#picking-a-primitive--tool-resource-or-prompt) |
| **Prompt** | A primitive *the user* invokes by name (slash command in Claude Code). Use for reusable workflows the user explicitly triggers. → [tool-design.md §Picking a Primitive](references/tool-design.md#picking-a-primitive--tool-resource-or-prompt) |
| `outputSchema` + `structuredContent` | Server contract: declaring `outputSchema` makes `structuredContent` MUST on every successful call. Declare for any tool returning machine-parseable data; always pair with a compact text preview. Owner for nullable / null-arm / `additionalProperties` rules: [tool-design.md §Schema Compatibility](references/tool-design.md#schema-compatibility-gotcha-anyof-with-null). |
| `isError` | The right channel for *business / validation* errors (agent self-corrects). Protocol exceptions are for malformed requests, not domain failures. |
| Tasks (SEP-1686) | Spec primitive for long-running ops. **Status (verified 2026-05-22):** no tracked client confirmed negotiating it — matrix shows `⚠️ not declared / unverified` across both Claude clients ([clients.md](references/clients.md#cross-client-capability-matrix)). Working default is the **roll-your-own async handle** (submit tool returns `{id, status: "working"}`; separate polling tool returns terminal state). Switch to the spec primitive when the matrix flips. Wire shape: [examples/long-running-tasks-wire-shape.md](examples/long-running-tasks-wire-shape.md). Decision tree: [tool-design.md §Long-Running Operations](references/tool-design.md#long-running-operations). |
| `_meta` | Spec-defined open-ended object on requests / results / tool definitions. Vendor-specific knobs ride here when the spec hasn't standardised them yet — e.g. Claude Code's `anthropic/maxResultSizeChars` is a namespaced field on the tool definition itself, not inside `_meta` (verify exact placement against the [Claude Code MCP docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) for your version). When in doubt: tool-level knobs go on the tool definition; per-call hints go in request `_meta`; per-result hints in result `_meta`. |
| `server.instructions` | Server-declared system prompt — a config surface for shaping agent behaviour without adding tools. Keep it tight; budget rules in [agent-ux.md](references/agent-ux.md#system-prompt-as-configuration-surface). SDK wiring (verified): FastMCP `instructions=` constructor arg; TypeScript SDK `Server` `instructions` field at construction. Other SDKs (Go, Rust, low-level Python `mcp`) expose the same `instructions` field on the server constructor — check the SDK's `Server`/`McpServer` reference. Caveat: MCP gateways/aggregators may replace or drop upstream server instructions; load-bearing rules must also be recoverable from tool descriptions, schemas, errors, or results. |
| Tool `annotations` | Posture hints (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) — advisory, not security. `title` is **top-level on the Tool object** per spec, not inside `annotations`. **Asymmetric default:** `destructiveHint` defaults to `true` (opt-out) but is **only meaningful when `readOnlyHint: false`** — on read-only tools it's ignored. Forgetting to set it to `false` on an additive write (e.g. `submit_feedback`) silently marks the tool destructive. → [tool-design.md §Annotations](references/tool-design.md#annotations). |
| `posture` (primary / secondary) | Project-level classification used by this skill (not a protocol field — secondary tools still appear in `tools/list` and count for the client). Primary = user-facing capability; secondary = plumbing (`health`, polling/status pairs, `submit_feedback`). Drives the ≤10 design signal, not a runtime filter. |
| `resource_link` | Tool result type that returns a URI pointer instead of inlining content. Design use: large payloads, already-addressable resources. Not guaranteed to appear in `resources/list`. |
| `icons` | Optional icon array on Tool/Resource/Prompt (SEP-973, spec 2025-11-25). Pure presentation — no client tracked in [clients.md](references/clients.md) is known to render them today. Design implication only when targeting clients that confirm rendering — don't invest in icon assets ahead of that confirmation. |

## Core Philosophy

- MCP servers are a **UI for agents**, not API wrappers
- Design tools around user goals — each tool completes an intent, not an endpoint
- Bundle orchestration (multiple API calls, data filtering, normalisation) inside the tool
- A good REST API is not a good MCP server — mapping endpoints 1:1 causes "tool pollution"
- **Tools are prompts.** Tool name and description are read by the LLM. Write for language models:
  explain *when* to call, *what triggers* the call, *what not to do*

## Tool Design

**Choose the right primitive first:**
- Model decides when to invoke it → **Tool**
- Stable, URI-addressable context the client pre-loads → **Resource** (see [tool-design.md §Picking a Primitive](references/tool-design.md#picking-a-primitive--tool-resource-or-prompt))
- User triggers an explicit reusable workflow by name → **Prompt** (see [tool-design.md §Picking a Primitive](references/tool-design.md#picking-a-primitive--tool-resource-or-prompt))

**Tool rules:**
- Names: `snake_case`, verb_noun — `list_dialogs`, `get_entity_info`, `submit_feedback`
- `title`: include on every tool `[OPINIONATED]` — spec marks it optional; in practice clients display it as user-facing prose. **Top-level on the Tool object** (not inside `annotations`). 1–3 words, product language, sentence case ("Search messages", not `search_messages`)
- `icons`: optional `{src, mimeType, sizes?[]}` array on Tool/Resource/Prompt (SEP-973, 2025-11-25)
- Classify each tool: `primary` (user-facing) or `secondary/helper` (plumbing)
- Annotate explicitly: `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`
- Mutating tools default to safe states: drafts, paused resources, dry-run, conservative limits
- Declare `outputSchema` on structured tools — when declared, MUST return `structuredContent` on every call (see glossary + tool-design.md)
- Use `isError: true` for business errors (validation, API failures) — never raise protocol exceptions for domain errors
- Error messages must be actionable: include what went wrong + diagnostic detail + `Action:` hint
- Flat parameter schemas — no bare `dict` / `object` without `properties`. Typed nested models with fully-declared `properties` at ≤1 level are fine; ≥2 levels hallucinate regardless of typing. → [tool-design.md §Argument Flattening](references/tool-design.md#argument-flattening)
- Hard-cap all list responses; include pagination token when truncated
- ≤10 primary tools is a signal, not a hard cap *(OPINIONATED — rationale and decision test in `references/tool-design.md` §Classification)*. Secondary tools that don't count against the budget: diagnostics (`health`, `version`); the roll-your-own polling tool paired with its submit tool ([tool-design.md §Long-Running Operations](references/tool-design.md#long-running-operations)); and the `submit_feedback` channel. *Secondary* is a design-time classification, not a runtime filter — these tools still appear in `tools/list`.
- Spec MUST: declare `tools` capability whenever the server exposes tools. Minimum is `"tools": {}`; upgrade to `"tools": {"listChanged": true}` only when your tool set mutates after init (auth gating, feature flags, multi-tenant). Declaring `listChanged: true` on a static surface misleads defenders into watching for events that never fire; delivery across clients is uneven — see [clients.md cross-client matrix](references/clients.md#cross-client-capability-matrix) and [tool-design.md §Dynamic Tool Sets](references/tool-design.md#dynamic-tool-sets--listchanged).

## Agent Feedback Channel *(OPINIONATED · CONDITIONAL)*

A useful pattern for **self-owned production servers with a maintainer who reads the queue** —
not an MCP protocol requirement. Skip this entirely for adversarial environments, deployments
without an active reviewer, or short-lived/demo servers — see
[feedback-tool.md §When NOT to use](references/feedback-tool.md#when-not-to-use).

If you adopt the pattern:

- Write-only for the agent — no read-back, no tracking ID, fire and forget
- Agent reports bugs, confusing behaviour, missing capabilities in the moment
- Operator reviews out-of-band via `feedback list` / `feedback status` / `feedback delete`
- Separate storage from the server's main data (own SQLite file or table)
- Pair with the system-prompt feedback directive — verbatim text + placement guidance at [agent-ux.md §Feedback directive](references/agent-ux.md#feedback-directive)

→ Full interface spec including severity, missing_capability, workaround_used, and the complete parameter contract: [references/feedback-tool.md](references/feedback-tool.md)

---

## Agent UX

- Tool descriptions serve two audiences: LLM (reads as prompt) and human (sees in UI). Write for LLM first
- **`elicitation`** (mid-call structured user input, supported by Claude Code, not by Claude Desktop — verify your client in [clients.md matrix](references/clients.md#cross-client-capability-matrix)) is the right channel for optional parameters that need clarification — use it instead of stuffing every conditional into the tool description. Cross-client safe path: design the tool to work without elicitation; treat elicitation as a UX upgrade when the negotiated capability is present. → [clients.md §Claude Code Design Implications](references/clients.md#design-implications-for-claude-code)
- System prompt (`server.instructions`): keep minimal — grow only when you see agents making wrong decisions without the directive. ALL-CAPS named workflow patterns, built dynamically at startup. Canonical ~100-word example covering all four content types: [agent-ux.md §System Prompt as Configuration Surface](references/agent-ux.md#system-prompt-as-configuration-surface)
- Two complementary UX checks: **dark-room** (run after each surface change — agent + server + real task + no briefing → review feedback queue; copy-paste prompt template: [agent-ux.md §Dark-Room Test](references/agent-ux.md#dark-room-test)) and **agent CustDev** (run once before the surface stabilises and after major redesigns — capable agents review the tool catalogue itself, no task; protocol: [agent-ux.md §Agent CustDev](references/agent-ux.md#agent-custdev)). Both require `submit_feedback` deployed.
- Error messages: include `Action:` hint for every recoverable error — agents act on error text directly

→ Full patterns: [references/agent-ux.md](references/agent-ux.md)

## Daemon + On-Demand Architecture `[STACK:stateful-backends]`

Skip this section unless your backend is stateful or requires shared infrastructure across tool calls.

→ [references/daemon-architecture.md](references/daemon-architecture.md) — daemon/MCP split,
Unix socket rules, crash isolation, when NOT to use this pattern.

---

## Transport

**Decision tree.** Disambiguate first: **is the client launching the server (subprocess), or connecting to a long-lived endpoint?** First matching branch wins, then keep walking for the auth layer.

- Client launches the server as a subprocess (Claude Desktop; Claude Code via `.mcp.json` with `"command"`; any CLI host)? → **`stdio`**. Same-machine, single-consumer, no port allocation, no Origin/DNS-rebinding surface.
- Client connects to a long-lived endpoint? → **Streamable HTTP**. Pick the auth shape by *who reaches the endpoint*:
  - Public internet, multiple/external users → **TLS + OAuth 2.1 per-principal, narrow scopes, audience-bound tokens** (RFC 8707). See `security-threats.md §3`.
  - Private network only (Tailscale, internal VPN, sibling containers) — single trusted user → TLS optional inside the trusted network; **a single shared token is still required** (defence in depth — the network is not the only attacker).
  - Internal Docker network with no untrusted neighbours → plaintext + auth terminated at a gateway (worked pairing row 2 below).

**Worked pairings:**

| Deployment shape | Transport | Auth |
|------------------|-----------|------|
| Claude Desktop / local Claude Code launches your server as a subprocess | `stdio` | none (process boundary) |
| Docker MCP gateway behind shared OAuth edge | `streamable-http` on `0.0.0.0:<port>` inside the docker network | OAuth 2.1 terminated at the gateway, not per backend |
| Personal / single-user server behind Tailscale, VPN, or private LAN | `streamable-http` (TLS if crossing untrusted hops) | single bearer token tied to the principal (do not skip — §0 applies even on private networks) |
| Remote SaaS server for external users (incl. remote Claude Code) | `streamable-http` + TLS | OAuth 2.1 per-principal; narrow scopes; audience-bound tokens |

**Streamable HTTP** = MCP's current HTTP transport (introduced in spec 2025-03-26, current in 2025-11-25): one endpoint accepting POST + GET, server picks `application/json` or `text/event-stream` per response. Replaces the HTTP+SSE transport (introduced in 2024-11-05, deprecated in 2025-03-26). **Design-binding rules** (the rest of the protocol shape is in the spec):

- Server MUST validate **both `Host` and `Origin`** (403 if invalid). `Host` is the load-bearing DNS-rebinding defence; `Origin` is defence in depth. **SDK defaults vary** — recent FastMCP enables protection only when bound to loopback, and mutating `host` post-construction silently bypasses it; TS SDK and others differ. Allow-list must match what your client actually sends, on the host you actually bind to. Full SDK footgun list + probes: [security-threats.md §0 — HTTP Origin + Host validation](references/security-threats.md#http-origin--host-validation-dns-rebinding-defence).
- Bind to localhost (not `0.0.0.0`) by default — relax only for the docker-network + auth-gateway pairing in the table above. Unix domain socket is the strongest mitigation (browsers cannot reach it).
- The old HTTP+SSE transport (introduced in spec 2024-11-05, deprecated in 2025-03-26) — never use it in new servers.
- `[STACK:remote-multi-server]` Put auth/proxy/ingress in front of a curated gateway, not in every backend server
- **For `stdio`: `stdout` is JSON-RPC only. Any other byte on `stdout` corrupts the transport silently.** This is the UNIVERSAL rule — applies to every stdio MCP server, every language, every SDK. Diagnostic / human-readable logging goes to `stderr`; structured event logs (e.g. JSONL usage logs) go to a file the server process owns — see [observability.md §Where to store](references/observability.md#where-to-store-opinionated-defaults). Probe: `your_server </dev/null >/tmp/out 2>/dev/null & pid=$!; sleep 1; kill $pid; wc -c </tmp/out` must print 0. The one exception is the daemon + on-demand pattern, where the MCP-server child is silent on **both** streams and logs travel to the daemon over the Unix socket — see [daemon-architecture.md §Stderr Rule](references/daemon-architecture.md#stderr-rule-reversed-under-this-pattern).

## Security

- **Prompt injection** — delimit untrusted content in tool responses; never inject raw message/file/DB content
- **Localhost exposure** — bind to `127.0.0.1` or Unix socket; never expose without auth on public interface
- **DNS rebinding (Streamable HTTP)** — validate both `Host` and `Origin` headers; SDK defaults vary and may silently bypass on `0.0.0.0` bindings. Canonical rule + footguns + probes: [security-threats.md §0](references/security-threats.md#http-origin--host-validation-dns-rebinding-defence)
- **Annotation trust** — annotations are hints, not security boundaries. Canonical statement + design implications: [tool-design.md §Annotations](references/tool-design.md#annotations)
- **Input boundary** — validate all paths, shell arguments, URLs, tenant IDs, and secrets server-side

→ Threat reference (data injection, authn/authz, sessions, DoS, secrets, supply chain, release stability): [references/security-threats.md](references/security-threats.md)

---

## Observability *(UNIVERSAL + OPINIONATED)*

Per-call logs drive dead-tool / hot-tool / error-rate decisions. Minimum fields: `ts`, `tool_name`, `status`, `duration_ms`. Never log raw args or responses (secrets, PII, prompt-injected content). → [references/observability.md](references/observability.md) for schema, storage patterns, privacy rules, report templates.

---

## Auditing an Existing Server

→ [references/audit-checklist.md](references/audit-checklist.md) — 16-section, ~80-item checklist,
`*` marks high-priority items, produces HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW findings summary.

**Precondition.** §1's 80/20 / dead-tool *usage-data* items require ≥30 days of production tool-call logs ([audit-checklist.md §1](references/audit-checklist.md#1-design-philosophy)). For a new or pre-production server, mark only those usage-data items N/A; the rest of §1 (tool count vs. ≤10 signal, 1:1 endpoint wrappers, outcome orientation, one-job scoping) reads on design alone — run it now and queue the usage-data rerun once traffic exists.

---

## Quick Checks

Before shipping or handing off:

- [ ] `title` set on every tool `[OPINIONATED]` — **top-level on the Tool object**, 1–3 words, sentence case, user-facing. *Skip when:* no client in your target matrix renders `title` distinctly from `name`.
- [ ] `server.instructions` reviewed `[OPINIONATED]` — empty / near-empty is worse than absent; either grow it to a real configuration surface or omit entirely. Budget + canonical shape: [agent-ux.md §System Prompt as Configuration Surface](references/agent-ux.md#system-prompt-as-configuration-surface).
- [ ] Tools designed for outcomes, not 1:1 endpoint wrappers
- [ ] Primary tool count scrutinised against the ≤10 signal `[OPINIONATED]` — see [tool-design.md §Tool Classification](references/tool-design.md#tool-classification--primary-vs-secondary-and-the-10-tool-signal). *Skip when:* surface intentionally domain-broad with prefix namespacing across many tools — namespacing carries the load instead.
- [ ] Mutating tools safe by default — draft/paused/dry-run unless explicit activation
- [ ] *(if adopting feedback pattern — see feedback-tool.md §When NOT to use)* `submit_feedback` present `[OPINIONATED]` — write-only, fire-and-forget; system prompt includes feedback directive. *Skip when:* no maintainer reads the queue, deployment is short-lived/demo, or environment is adversarial.
- [ ] `outputSchema` declared tools always return `structuredContent` (MUST)
- [ ] Business errors use `isError: true` with actionable diagnostics — no protocol exceptions
- [ ] For `stdio`, `stdout` is JSON-RPC only; diagnostic logs go to `stderr`, structured event logs to a file the server owns
- [ ] For Streamable HTTP, `Host` **and** `Origin` allow-lists are configured **for the host you actually bind to** (loopback-default SDK protection silently bypasses on `0.0.0.0`) — see [security-threats.md §0](references/security-threats.md#http-origin--host-validation-dns-rebinding-defence)
- [ ] No bare `dict` / `object` without `properties` in parameter schemas; typed nested models OK at ≤1 level
- [ ] Per-call usage log in place `[OPINIONATED]` — `ts`, `tool_name`, `status`, `duration_ms` minimum. *Skip when:* pre-production / dev server with no real traffic — treat as debt to clear before first production deploy.
- [ ] No raw argument values or response bodies in any log `[UNIVERSAL]` — applies whether or not the usage log above exists; raw values may carry secrets, PII, or prompt-injected content.

---

## What's Evolving

- **If your tool returns HTML/JSON for rendering — keep `structuredContent` schema-stable.** MCP Apps ([SEP-1865](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps)) is rolling out a `ui://` rendering extension; stable schemas keep its later adoption non-breaking.
- **`sampling/createMessage` works in spec but neither tracked client declares the capability.** The 2025-11-25 spec keeps sampling and adds SEP-1577 (sampling with tools / server-side agent loops); only `includeContext` is soft-deprecated. But neither Claude Desktop nor Claude Code declares the `sampling` capability ([clients.md](references/clients.md#cross-client-capability-matrix)) — so designing around sampling today produces dead code on those clients. Acceptable to *include* a sampling code path behind a capability check; not acceptable to make a primary tool's behaviour depend on it.
- **Long-running tools today: the roll-your-own async handle is the working mechanism; `taskSupport: "optional"` is a future-leaning hedge.** `taskSupport` (per-tool field declared via the Tasks SEP) is a no-op on clients that don't negotiate the `tasks` capability — and no client in [clients.md](references/clients.md#cross-client-capability-matrix) is confirmed to do so today (2026-05-22). For Claude Desktop's defensive ≤20s heuristic (one observation: socket closed at 26s; see [clients.md §Timeouts](references/clients.md#timeouts) — not a documented ceiling), only the roll-your-own handle protects you; declaring `taskSupport: "optional"` alongside is harmless and switches on automatically when clients catch up. Reserve `taskSupport: "required"` until the matrix flips. Wire shape: [examples/long-running-tasks-wire-shape.md](examples/long-running-tasks-wire-shape.md).
