### Quality Rating

Quality is rated on **four dimensions**:

1. **Structure** — Progressive disclosure, references/, examples/, clear organization
2. **Completeness** — All sections present, no missing content
3. **Depth** — Insights beyond surface level, practical patterns, deep understanding
4. **Originality** — Unique approach or just packaging existing docs/tools

| Stars | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Exemplary — deep + original + comprehensive | gh (mental model), mcp-builder (evaluation tools), kaizen (code adaptation) |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High quality — good depth + well-structured | dignified-bash, linux-sysadmin, meeting-insights-analyzer |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Solid — complete but shallow/standard | changelog-generator (just workflow), opencode-config (config reference) |
| ⭐⭐ | Incomplete — needs expansion or examples | software-architecture, web-artifacts-builder, web-design-guidelines |

**Why downgraded from 5→3 stars?**
- Just a workflow without deep insights (changelog-generator)
- Simple reference/config guide (git-workflow-manager, opencode-config)
- Packaging existing docs without original approach (vercel-react-best-practices)
- Utility skill without depth (claude-md-redirect)
